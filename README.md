# UV2PhongEdges

Script for Cinema 4D to harden the edges that are attached to UV borders (break Phong shading)

Video example https://vimeo.com/330305923

#### Known issues
- Undo doesn't work
- The script may take some time for med-poly objects (1-2 min or even more). Be patient please :)
- The `Texture View` window must be opened at least once for properly work :(
Just close it and continue work.

I'm going to fix these issues in the future. In the far future.. I haven't got much spare time. 

Feel free to ask any questions about the script, report bugs and so on.
